# Ecom_Transaction_analysis
The Babylist store offers ~5,000 SKUs that are sold by Babylist to consumers. When an item is not in-stock (e.g., the unit is not on hand at the warehouse to be shipped to the consumer), Babylist refers the user to other retailers where they can purchase the good. Key information around orders of goods from our e-commerce store is contained in 3 tables: Bl_fulfillment_order_items table, Bl_fulfillment_orders table and Bl_fulfillment_order_state table. 

We care about our e-commerce revenue growth and supporting that growth with the right amount of operational investment. Poor operational execution - carrying the wrong items, the wrong level of inventory, and the timeliness in which we fulfill orders - negatively impacts the customer experience. Please address the following in your presentation: 

+ How healthy are our sales? 
  + What’s our average daily order volume and how has it changed over time? ○ Are there any patterns that emerge from the order volatility? 
  + What types of patterns do you notice about types or quantities of items ordered? 
  + Analyze orders containing bottles. Are there any patterns/trends that you notice? 
  + What is the breakdown of purchases from users vs non-users and how has this changed over time? 
  
+ How are we doing from an order fulfillment perspective? 
  + How many orders are we shipping out on average? 
  + For orders created within the last 30 days what’s the % of orders that shipped (state = ‘shipped’) within 12hrs, 12-24hrs, 24-48hrs, greater than 48hrs? And how does that change over time? 
  + Is there a pattern on what is shipping out faster or slower than other items?
